# AI-Course-Projects
My solutions to the course project for my university AI course, which was based on the pacman challenges used by UC Berkeley

Achievements so far:
1. Designed a heuristic to expand <3500 nodes using A* search to find the optimal path, well below the upper limit for full credit (9000) 
2. Designed appropriate evaluation functions for minimax search (multi-agent games) to perform well above full credit requirements

Running the repo on your computer:
Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. The 'ai_env' folder has the files needed to set up a virtual environment to run the project. Run 'source ai_env/bin/activate' from inside the 'AI-Course-Projects' directory. If that doesn't work out, delete the ai_env folder and create your own virtual env. I also recommend installing ipdb
