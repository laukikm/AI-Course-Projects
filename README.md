# AI-Course-Projects
My solutions to the course project for my university AI course, which was based on the pacman challenges used by UC Berkeley

Achievements so far:
1. Designed a heuristic to expand <3500 nodes using A* search to find the optimal path, well below the upper limit for full credit (9000) 
2. Designed appropriate evaluation functions for minimax search (multi-agent games) to perform well above full credit requirements
